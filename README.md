# Favorite-Book-SwiftUI-
This is an app built completely with SwiftUI and shows users favorite movies and bands. First, I used Favorite Model file to generate my elements. In this file, I benefited from structs and initialized them to form bands and movies. Moreover, in Content View file, I used , List, and section and for each loops in order to demonstrate the elements in list form. Furthermore, I benefited from Navigaiton View and Navigaiton Link to perform segue to different screen. Finally, in Details View, I used VStack and other functions to show the selected element in this screen.
